#summary Technical requirements needed to develop and run OpenPEX
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

This document describes the prerequisites needed for developing and running OpenPEX. In terms of server resources, you require n number of nodes (where n > 1) to run as worker nodes in the OpenPEX system. These nodes must be 64bit capable and have the hardware VT extensions available to them. These nodes will have XenServer installed on them (described below) and will erase any previously installed operating systems on that machine. You also need a gateway node that runs the OpenPEX software. This node needs a Java environment and application server, and also a NFS mount to host the Virtual Machine Images. This node should be relatively capabl but does not have to be 64bit or have hardware VT extensions. We recommend Ubuntu 8.04 or 9.04 as the operating system on the gateway node.


= Details =

The following items are required to successfully develop and run OpenPEX.
  * NetBeans 6.5.1
  * IceFaces 1.8
  * XenServer 5
  * Glassfish v2 application server
  * Java 1.5 or higher
  * MySQL

= NetBeans =
NetBeans is the preferred development and deployment platform that is utilised for OpenPEX. Download the latest release from <a href="www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>. At the time of writing, this is version 6.5.1. Choose the "All" bundle to ensure you have all the necessary components.

= IceFaces =
We utilise IceFaces for the Web Portal inferface of OpenPEX. Download the latest NetBeans bundle for IceFaces from the IceFaces <a href="http://www.icefaces.org/main/downloads/os-downloads.iface">website</a> and follow the enclosed instructions that describe how to install these modules inside NetBeans. At the time of writing, the latest IceFaces bundle was ICEfaces-1.8.0-NetBeans-6.5.1-modules-a.zip.

= XenServer =
Download the latest version of Citrix XenServer from <a href="http://www.citrix.com">citrix.com</a>. <a href="http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/lp/lp_1688615.asp">This link</a> should take you directly to the download page. Download the Installer and the Linux Guest Support iso's and create installation CD's from them. At the time of writing the latest version of the Installer was FREE_XenServer-5.0.0-Update3-install.iso and the the Linux Guest Support was FREE_XenServer-5.0.0-Update3-linux.iso. Install Consult the <a href="http://www.citrix.com/xenserver_documentation_free">documentation</a> for assistance on installing XenServer on your machines.

= Gateway node =
Here we will explain how to configure the gateway node to run OpenPEX. These instructions have been tested for a physical installation of Ubuntu 8.0.4 LTS, however they should work for Ubuntu 9.0.4. 

Install a copy of Ubuntu Server 8.0.4 (or 9.0.4) onto the node you wish to utilise as the gateway. Once the installation has completed and the node has rebooted, execute the following commands to install the required software:

{{{
%apt-get update
%apt-get upgrade
%apt-get install mysql-server
%apt-get install libmysql-java
%apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
%apt-get install glassfishv2
%apt-get install apache2 phpmyadmin
}}}

{{{%cp /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-5.1.5.jar /usr/share/glassfishv2/lib}}}


{{{%vi /usr/bin/asadmin}}}

Change

GF_DOMAIN_DIR=$HOME/glassfishv2

To,

GF_DOMAIN_DIR=/var/lib/glassfishv2/domains

== Add PEX MySQL database and user ==

Open /etc/mysql/my.cnf and comment out the `bind-address` line as follows:

# bind-address          = 127.0.0.1

{{{%mysql -u root -p}}}

{{{mysql> CREATE DATABASE pex;}}}

{{{mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES ON pex.* TO 'pexadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpass';}}}

== Change the default glassfish passwords ==

Go to http://yourip:4848/ and click on Domain->Administrator Password

Change the password from the default ('adminadmin') to the password of your choice. Click 'Save'

== Add MySQL Java support to glassfish ==
While still in the glassfish management console, click on Resources->JDBC->Connection Pools. Click on 'New'.

Under General Settings, set the name as 'msqlPool', the Resource Type as 'javax.sql.DataSource' and the Database Vendor as MySQL. Hit 'Next'.

Under Additional Properties set the User as root and the password to be the root MySQL password you set earlier. Click 'Finish' when done.

Under Resources> JDBC> Connection Pools the 'msqlPool' should be listed. Click on the JNDI link and then 'Ping' this connection to verify it works.

= Preparing the XenServer Resource Pool =

Install the XenCenter software on an available Windows machine that can easily connect over the network to the XenServer nodes you have installed.
